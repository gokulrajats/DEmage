#Algorithm
Choose image
Convert the text into array and convert each character into ascii 

Read RGB color from the pixel of the Image and Insert each character in the green value of the pixel.


# Note : 
You need to make space in pixel between each character in the image. Because if you change all pixels of the image then it may forms like a line.
